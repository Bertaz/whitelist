## <ins>Overview</ins>
  <br />

| File Name | Domain Count | Description | Update Frequency | Raw Link |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| whitelist.txt | 191 | This file contain domains that are __safe__ to whitelist i.e. it does not contain any tracking or advertising sites. Adding this file fixes many problems like YouTube watch history, videos on news sites and so on. If you want to report additional domain feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/Bertaz/whitelist/issues). | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bertaz/whitelist/master/domains/whitelist.txt) |
| optional-list.txt | 140 | This file contain domains that are needed to be whitelisted depending on the service you use. It may contain some tracking site but sometimes it's necessary to add bad domains to make a few services to work. Currently there is no script for this list, you have to add domains manually to your Pi-Hole. | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bertaz/whitelist/master/domains/optional-list.txt) |

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Bertaz/whitelist.git
cd whitelist/scripts
sudo ./whitelist.sh

__Note: You don't have to clone the repo every time you need to update whitelist file. Navigate to `whitelist/scripts` and run it again `sudo ./whitelist.sh`__
        
#### For optional-list.txt
You can add it manually depending upon the service you use.

## <ins>How do I determine an ad domain?</ins>
- __Adam:ONE Assistant (formerly DNSthingy Assistant):__ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adamone-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.
- __Using inbuilt Developer tool:__ For Chrome and Firefox, __`ctrl+shift+I`__ will land you in Developer tools menu.
- __Using an Android app:__ [__`Net Guard`__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard) is an Android app that can be used to monitor any specific apps, works on unrooted devices too.
